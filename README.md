# Weekly Reports


## Week 11
We're back after Christmas break, I did not accomplish as much as I wished, I kept getting stuck on my Kivy app. One thing that was pointed out was my lack of GitHub uploads, something I intend on working on over the coming weeks. The issue there was the lack of progress made, I saw no sense in uploading when I had not accomplished something. Anyway the next few weeks will be spent on transitioning over to C++, something I've been looking forward too for quite some time.

## Week 12
I'm still working on my Kivy app and still have not begun my tinkering audio. I didn't understand my hesitation in this, I liked to think that I understood the theory of it but in practice I had no idea where to start, Warwick a class mate had agreed to accompany me back to my house to help start the project, it really aided in giving me a push in the right direction. On top of this we had our peer reviews this week, with everyone slowly coming to terms with talking to one and other its getting easier to do these reviews.

## Week 13
It all came down to this week for all four of our projects my tinkering projects are quite complete, but my Kivy app still needs work to be a viable game. My server project is none existent, I will not be repeating the mistakes of that project. My main issue was not asking for help when it was needed and not repeatedly attempting the task at hand. Luckily we not longer have to use Python though a strong scripting language and very versatile in its uses I personally have no interest in continuing with it, although my opinion may change as I learn more.

## Week 14
I have not started worksheet 4 yet, I have found that I wanted to use the second week of the holiday to work on it. Other than that I am not doing anything, this could be unwise as a lack of constant workflow can lead to loss of much needed practice.

## Week 15
I have attempted to begin the Mandelbrot Set and the Hacking terminal. I have come to the conclusion that I should have started it earlier. These two solutions are more complex than I first realised, although the Mandelbrot is coming to me easier than the hacking it my time is still quite stretched. I hadn't finished this worksheet until late the Sunday before I handed it in on the Wednesday. So the usual conclusion for me is to begin earlier and spread my time between projects.

## Week 16
We had the first of out extra programing sessions this week, I found that it was most useful, as we created a small text based adventure game. we've also been introduced to SDL a rather confusing C++ library for 2D games. Although I'm keeping the thought that in time I will understand, as I have a tendency to panic when I don't fully understand something. Looking back it seems I have come quite far though. I have been tasked with designing a game for the COMP150 projects and will present it next week.

## Week 17
We had out game pitches this week, I was thoroughly surprised at my 
success. Overall my game design came third and I have been placed in a group with Milly, Harriet, and Jodie. I'm feeling confident that with the right changes/refinement to the game design that it could be a relatively good game, however "good" can be defined. It seems the tutors are planning things very carefully as most of the tutoring id now directly related to our projects. I believe this is a good move as it will keep people interested, speaking for myself this is definitely the case.

## Week 21
We handed in our controllers this Monday, it went well although I feel as though my technical insight into the build of my controller was overlooked somewhat. Mike has said that they might look into making that a greater aspect of the marking criteria, to more match the creative aspect of the project. I have worked on our COMP150 game some more, I feel that it is going well and am beginning to study AI behaviour trees more closely as this is what I shall be doing for my COMP110 coding task 2. Over the next few weeks I need to put more effort into my essay and find a greater balance in what work I attempt.
